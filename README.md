📢*Hello..*📢

⏱ I've been working on programing since the end of summer of 2020.⏱ 

✨ Worked with Javascript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Some typescript. ✨
✨ Really social, and spend quite a big amount of time on games (Valorant) ✨
✨ Comfortable with calls. ✨
✨ Can make very clean code, and will always do a lot of research in attempt to make the code faster and better. ✨

:)

Currently working on:
- [Cipher6](https://ellabot.xyz/pages/testing.html) - This is a cipher website for Codebusters from science olympiad to practice their decryption skills. 


Last project:

- [${Ella}🤖](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=743292394237329440&scope=bot&permissions=8) - The project I've worked on since the very begining of my career.
